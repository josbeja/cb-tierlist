# Falconetti Gunners

The **Falconetti Gunners** are the quintessential mobile artillery unit. Defined as a "Glass Cannon," they are capable of dissolving entire formations and armored heroes from the safety of the rear, provided they have adequate protection.

## 1. Overview and Stats

- **Era/Tier:** Golden Age (5 stars) - Season 3.
- **Leadership:** Reduced from 350 to approximately **300 points**, making them easier to include in the warband.

- **Unit Size:** 10 base units, expandable to **12** with veteran status.

- **Damage Type:** Blunt Damage. This is vital because it ignores a large portion of heavy shield defense and blocking.

- **Effective Range:** Up to **110 meters**, allowing them to compete with field artillery and outrange most archers.

## 2. Critical Abilities and Traits

- **Deployment (Keys 1 and 2):** They require **2 seconds** to kneel and set up their cannons before firing. They are completely immobile while deployed.

- **Precision Volley:** Active ability with a **16-second cooldown**. Ignores shields and has a massive headshot damage multiplier.

- **Gunnery Officer:** Allows firing at targets outside of visual range if the zone is manually marked.

- **Encumbered:** They cannot climb ladders or push machinery. Their only escape route is via ramps.

- **Deadzone:** They cannot fire at anything within **10 meters**. If the enemy gets too close, the unit becomes useless.

## 3. Veteran Paths

There are three main approaches depending on playstyle:

- **Lower Path (Recommended - "Shotgun"):** Increases the unit size to **12 cannons** (+20% burst damage) and grants **30% movement speed.** Its lower accuracy is often an advantage, as missed shots tend to hit enemy reinforcements behind the front line.

- **Upper Path (Precision Sniper):** Maximizes range and accuracy. Ideal for destroying siege engines (towers, battering rams) and countering enemy artillery. Its major weakness is its extremely slow movement speed.

- **Hybrid Path:** Combines up to the speed node in the bottom lane and the remaining accuracy nodes in the top lane for players who master unit micromanagement.

## 4. Best in Slot (BIS) Doctrines

To maximize your potential in the current meta, prioritize:

1. **Cannon Accuracy and Range:** Vital for reducing projectile spread.

2. **Epic Mobility (Sprint) Doctrine:** Grants an 8-9 second speed boost, essential for repositioning or escaping from trebuchets.

## 5. Advanced Gameplay and Tactics

### The "Pro" Fire Routine

1. **Deployment:** Position yourself behind a shield wall or on high ground.

2. **Manual Aiming:** Do not aim directly at the unit; aim slightly **ahead (towards the ground)** to compensate for the shot's arc and maximize area-of-effect (AoE) damage.

3. **Relocation:** After two salvos, cancel deployment and move **15-20 meters**. This prevents enemy artillery from pinpointing your position and allows you to find new firing angles.

### Strategic Role

- **Active:** Suppress entrances and corridors, and destroy siege engines before they reach the walls.

- **Reactive:** Disrupt massed advances (pushes) and cover breaks in the allied line with explosions that knock down the enemy.

## 6. Synergies and Security

The Falconetti should never be alone. They require a constant "Escort":

- **Shield Wall:** Imperial Guardsmen or Stalwarts to block arrows and charges.

- **Support Pikes:** Phalanx, Modaos, or Imperial Pikes positioned **behind** the shields to stop cavalry attempting to jump the line.

- **Vision:** Synergy with scout units that detect flanking maneuvers by fast units or invisible heroes.

- **Your Role as a Hero:** Your mission is not to kill, but to control crowds (CC) and buy time for your allies to eliminate anyone trying to approach your cannons.

**Your Role as a Hero:** ## 7. Commander's Checklist (Resource Management)

- **Ammunition:** It is limited and expensive. Resupply at the supply point every **4 or 5 rounds**.

- **Communication:** Warn your allies (voice or map signals) when you are going to fire so they can take advantage of the enemy down and advance.

- **Maintain your distance:** Always keep a clear safety zone (approximately 10 meters) around your unit.

- **Recommended Maps:** White Elk Fort, Riverlands Castle, Valley Fortress, Harbour City, Wallfort, and Dasuo Fort.

## 8. Main Threats

- **Shock Cavalry (Anti-CC):** (Yanyeudao, Xuanjia, Hussars) can wipe you out in a second if they flank you.

- **Artillery and Mortars:** They have greater range and are the natural counter to Falconetti's static nests.

- **Damage over Time (DoT):** Muskets and poison are lethal; losing even two artillerymen reduces the unit's effectiveness by 20%.

- **Lag and Crashes:** In the current meta, playing at short/mid range (Lower Route) mitigates trajectory errors caused by server instability.
